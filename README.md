This is a tiny java program that simplify debt relations among multiple people.
To help my friend Congxin who need to spend much time calculating the debt relation among a 4,5 people group, I made this program to enable everyone know who and how much to pay.

For the format of the input txt file, first fill in the names of all people at the first line. Beginning from the second line to fill in the following information: the one who paid, the amount of the money, a string with 1s and 0s to represent who need to pay this bill. Trick: fill in "a" to represent that everyone else except the payer need to pay this bill.
